# Fast Connect 3 Credential Insertion API for Citrix Workspace app for Windows

The Fast Connect 3 Credential Insertion API provides an interface that supplies user credentials to the single sign-on (SSO) feature of Citrix Workspace app for Windows. Using this API, Citrix partners can provide authentication and SSO products that use StoreFront or the Web Interface to log users on to
Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops and then disconnect users from those sessions.

The system requirements and prerequisites for the API are the same as those for Citrix Workspace app. Note that XenDesktop 7 does not support the Web Interface.

The Fast Connect 2 API is still available, but can be used only with Receiver for Windows 3.4.
If you are using Citrix Workspace app for Windows Version 4.11 and later, install the Microsoft Visual 2017 C++ Redistributable Package using the following link:
